<h3>Next Major Build</h3>
<p>V0.7a will be the next major build after 0.6.5a, if 0.6.5a is stable enough</p>
<p>V0.7 is planned to be fully compiled and released if the program seems stable enough in the proper releases tab. If all goes to plan V0.8/0.9 will be RC builds working more on QOL and program efficeny rather than features.</p>
<h4>Stability of Build</h4>
<p>6/10 - Haven't experinced many issues, but many features being added have left loose ends making the program feel broken and unfinished, somewhat worse than the last build, the only thing saving it is the fact that it does more.</p>

<h2>1/10/2025 - Build V0.6.8b - PVT1</h2>
<p>Wow, it's amazing how much a bit of TLC and learning can do!</p>
<p>This build will contain a full release, but it is still a beta and is unfinished</p>
<p>MAJOR NOTE: THIS BUILD WAS FULLY WRITTEN BY HAND ONLY CORRECTED WHEN NEEDED WITH AI, NO FEATURES WERE IMPLEMENTED USING AI ONLY PATCHED</p>
