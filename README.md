# RDPro
A Remote Desktop Wrapper Application, Designed and Invisioned by yours truly, and programmed with mostly AI**

<h1>Why Remote Desktop - Pro?</h1>
Remote desktop Pro is an application that is designed to make the use of the old school mstc.exe easier!, it allows for most of the functionality of the old program all in one neat interface powered by .NET Framework 8.0 using Fluent Avalonia AXAML styled formating with Reactive UI. The Program was thought of on a whim by myself when the default Windows app for Windows 10 & 11 failed to fufill what I needed, Goodbye needing a Microsoft Account just to access remote computers! RD Pro allows Grouping*, Gateway Management, User Name storage, Friendly Names, Display & Experince Settings* and Folder/Drive/Printer Redirections*
<p></p>
The Program supports all Password Based Authentication Files from a default mstc.exe and makes its own .rdp files for storing, meaning you can export the files for use in mstc.exe at any time. All RDPro related formatting/sorting is stored in it's very own .rdpx file with a UUID that matches the .rdp file, this allows all of the neat features it adds, without ruining the ability to easily go back!

The program will have more capabilites like exporting settings, reseting user settings and Versioning added in a later version. But for now my main goal is to deliver a full functioning app and work on QOL later.

<h1>Why AI?</h1>
I have no experince in programming in C#/xml of any sort, I wanted this program really badly, and needed it soon!, I tried making a python version, but it never met my standards so with the help of GPT-5 mini and Gemini in VS Code, i was able to make the application so much quicker, and have learnt a fair bit along the way. For the above reasons, while this program was based on my own ideas, I have no problem admitting that only a very small fraction the complex code is my own, whilst the rest is written by AI or modified versions of my own code AI had to patch. Whilst I would love to call the app my own doing, it would have taken too long for the time I had to get it done and working and thats why it is the way it is. I have carefully bug tested it along the way and patched some mistakes myself, most of which were syntax errors. I hope in the future that some other people may take the project on to help me, and eventually make it man-written.

<h1>What's Next?</h1>
Since the program is overall a wrapper for an existing Windows program, (mstc.exe - Remote Desktop Connection), the possibilities are limitted to what it can do, the main goal for the program is to make mstc.exe as nice as the new program that is meant to replace it, whilst giving people the control that mstc offers. Sadly Microsoft may phase out mstc in the future in favour for their terrible replacement app. The dreaded (Windows App), but realistically, I would just move on and try making mstc a part of the program instead of just calling it, like right now.

<h1>Whats the go with Updates?</h1>
Since I am a novice updates will be slow, unless people join in, my main idea is make a program that is worth using, upload it and then when I need or think of new features slowly patch it in overtime.

<h1>Where's the downloads?</h1>
Good question check the releases tab for info on downloads, if you find nothing there, its safe to say that the program is still too buggy and I have yet to release a stable version.
